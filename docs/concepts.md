# Overview
React-Static is different from most React-based static-site generators. It follows a very natural flow from data all the way to static files, then finally a progressively enhanced react-app. Not only does this provide a safe separation of concern, but by keeping the data pipelining and react templating as separate as possible, your site can be visualized and built in a single pass as a "function of state" from the data you pass it.

### Dev Stage
1. **All of the data your site needs to render** is gathered up-front in your `static.config.js` by any means you want. This data can come from markdown files, headless CMS's, graphql endpoints, etc.
2. Using your data, you define or generate **every static route** for your site and supply the appropriate data to each one.
3. Simultaneously, you provide each route with the component that should be used to render it.
4. Using React-Static's components like `RouteProps` and `SiteProps` you can access the data for each route and use it to render your site!
5. React-Static can then export every page in your site with tenacious speed and accuracy.

### Client Stage
1. On first page load, only the bare minimum of assets are downloaded to show the content as quickly as possible. This includes the page specific HTML and CSS that were exported at build time.
2. Simultaneously, only the necessary boostrap code, template code and data needed to mount react for that particular route are **pushed** to the browser.
3. React invisibly mounts over the rendered HTML
4. The rest of the website is optimistically pre-cached
5. All further navigation is seemingly instantaneous!

# Code, Data, and Prop Splitting
React Static also has a very unique and amazing way of requesting the least amount of data to display any given page at just the right moment. React splits code and data based on these factors:

- **Routes** - Under the hood, React Static is automatically handling route splitting for you. Other than listing your routes in your `static.config.js`, you don't have to do anything!
- **Route Data & Shared Data** - Each route's `getData` function results in a separate data file for each route being stored (usually). While exporting this data however, each individual key of every data object is checked against each other for `===` equality. When a data key is found to be used in more than one route, it is promoted to a *shared data fragment* and stored in its own file.
- **Manual Code Splitting with Universal** - React Static comes built in with support for [`react-universal-component`](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component). This means aside from the automatic code splitting that React Static offers, you can also manually code split very large components if you choose to do so. See the ["About" page in the dynamic-imports example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/dynamic-imports/src/containers/about.js) to see how it works and how easy it is!


#### Why is all of this cool?
By bundling page templates and data into separate optimized files, your site avoids wastefully loading duplicate assets for pages that share some or all of their assets with others. This decreases the overall bandwidth your site uses and also considerably speeds up your site's ability to serve content as fast as possible!

#### Shared Route Data Example
Shared Route Data can be difficult to understand without an example. So, consider a dynamic menu structure that is present only on some of your pages, but not all of them. In this case, the menu data should only be loaded on the pages that use it, and only once per session (cached), instead of on every page individually.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  getRoutes: async () => {
    const supportMenu = getMyDynamicMenu()
    return [
      {
        path: '/',
        component: 'src/containers/Home',
      },
      {
        path: '/docs',
        component: 'src/containers/Docs',
        getData: async () => ({
          supportMenu // Used once here
        })
      },
      {
        path: '/help',
        component: 'src/containers/Help',
        getData: async () => ({
          supportMenu, // Used again here! Since this `supportMenu` is equal `===` to the
          // `supportMenu` used in the docs route, both instances will be promoted to
          // a shared prop and only loaded once per session!
          helpStuff: {...} // All other props that are unique to the route are
          // still stored in their own JSON file.
        })
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

#### Important Notes
Automatic data and prop splitting is based on identity comparison `===`. If you break this referential integrity, React Static cannot detect that two props are the same.

**An example of what not do**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  getRoutes: async () => {
    const supportMenu = getMyDynamicMenuFromMyCMS()
    return [
      {
        path: '/',
        component: 'src/containers/Home',
      },
      {
        path: '/docs',
        component: 'src/containers/Docs',
        getData: async () => ({
          supportMenu
        })
      },
      {
        path: '/help',
        component: 'src/containers/Help',
        getData: async () => ({
          supportMenu { ...supportMenu } // Even though this supportMenu obejct
          // is exactly the same as the original, it is not the actual original.
          // This would not work!
        })
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

# 404 Handling
Making a 404 page in React Static is extremely simple. Define a route with `is404` set to `true` and a `component` path to render the 404 page. Note that no `path` property is needed for a 404 route. At both build-time and runtime, the rendered result of this `component` will be used for any routes that are not found.

# Non-Static Routing
Sometimes you may want to handle routes that should not be statically rendered. In that case, you can treat `Routes` like any other `react-router` route and use any of the routing components you normally use with `react-router`.

**Important Notes**
- React-Router components are available via the `react-static` import. There is no need to import them via `react-router`!
- Any custom React-Router components must be placed before `<Routes>` if you want them to match. The `<Routes>` component is a catch all `<Route path='*' />` handler, so anything below it will result in a 404!
- The `Routes` component is in fact a `react-router` `Route` component, so it can be placed and used normally within components like `<Switch>`!

Example - Handling a non-static admin route:
```javascript
import { Router, Routes, Route, Switch } from 'react-static'

import Admin from 'containers/Admin'

export default () => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route path='/admin' component={Admin} /> // If /admin path is matched
      <Routes /> // Otherwise, fall back to static route handlers
    </Switch>
  </Router>
)
```

# Webpack Customization and Plugins
React-Static ships with a wonderful default webpack config, carefully tailored for react development. It should support a majority of use-cases on its own. But, in the case you do need to modify the webpack configuration, use the handy [`webpack` property in your `static.config.js` file](#/api/#webpack).

# Using Preact in Production
Who wouldn't want to make their JS bundle as small as possible? Simply set `preact: true` in your `static.config.js` and React-Static will ship preact with your site instead of React. This can significantly reduce the size of your app and load times!

**Example**
```javascript
// static.config.js
export default {
  preact: true,
}
```

**Note**: If updating a project not originally based on the `preact` template, you will need to update the render method of your app to always use `ReactDOM.render` and not `ReactDOM.hydrate`. [See the preact template for an example of this](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/preact/src/index.js#L14)

**Important**
Due to the complexity of maintaining a fully tooled development experience, React is still used in development mode if `preact` is set to `true`. This ensures that stable hot-reloading tooling, dev tools, ect. are used. This is by no means permanent though! If you know what it takes to emulate React Static's development environment using Preact tooling, please submit a PR!
