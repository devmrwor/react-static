# Roadmap

## Next (v6)

Version 6 is a massive upgrade to the underlying tools that power react-static and also offers some new conveniences and features not possible before. These include:

- React 16 (now default)
- Babel 7
- Webpack 4
- New React-Universal-Component
- Extract-CSS-Chunks-Webpack-Plugin
- Multi-threaded Export
- Plugin System
- Pages directory support

**Todo**

These items still need to be fleshed out completely before release

- Release automation
- The rest of the possible API and interface for plugins
- General testing

## Ideas

Below are some items that may or may not be included in future versions of React-Static:

- Codesandbox Template
- Multi-threaded Webpack builds
- Suspense-compatible exporting
- Suspense-compatible routing
