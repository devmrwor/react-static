## Getting started with the source code!

* Install the latest stable version of node
* Install the latest stable version of `yarn` (We use yarn workspaces, so `npm` will not work for development)
* Clone the `react-static` repo to your machine
* Run `yarn` in the root of the repository (will install all dependencies (deduped) for all packages)
* Run a script
  - `yarn watch` - Watches the core packages for changes and compiles them for development
  - `yarn build` - Builds all packages for release
  - `yarn test` - Runs the testing suite for all packages
  - `yarn startDocs` - Starts the documentation site in development mode
