[**Read the introduction article on Medium**](https://medium.com/@tannerlinsley/%EF%B8%8F-introducing-react-static-a-progressive-static-site-framework-for-react-3470d2a51ebc)

At [Nozzle.io](https://nozzle.io), we take **SEO, site performance, and user/developer experience** very seriously. Weâ€™ve launched many sites using different static site tools that claim to solve these goals, but we have yet to find one that satisfies our requirements completely. React-Static is the framework we carefully designed to meet those standards and help everyone build next generation, high-performance websites for the internet.

## Features
- React. Enough said.
- Blazing fast performance.
- Data Agnostic. Feed your site data from anywhere, **however you want**.

```

## CLI

#### `react-static create`
Creates a new react-static project.
- Prompts for a project name/location
- Prompts to select one of the templates located in this repository's `examples/` directory.

#### `react-static start`
Starts the development server.

#### `react-static build`
Builds your site for production. Outputs to a `dist` directory in your project.

## Project Setup
`react-static` needs a few directories and files in the right places to function properly:

- `static.config.js` - A javascript configuration file for react-static. [Click here to see an example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/basic/static.config.js)
- `public/` - Anything in this directory will be merged into your static `dist` directory. All files in this directory can be accessed at the root of your site.
- `src/` - a place for all of your code
  - `index.js` - the main entry for your app. This file should export your app as its default export and also handle the rendering of the app when using the development server. [Click here to see an example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/basic/src/index.js).

## Configuration (`static.config.js`)
A `static.config.js` file is required at your project root to configure react-static. It must export a **default** object with the following interface:
```javascript
export default {
  // getRoutes is the only required method for the entire config.
  // It is an asynchronous function that should
  // resolve an array of route objects. It is also passed a `dev`
  // boolean indicating whether this is a production build or not.
  getRoutes: async ({dev}) => [{
    path: '/' // A route object only requires a `path` string
  }, {
    path: '/blog',
    children: [{ // It can also contained nested routes
      path: '/post-1',
      getProps: async ({route, dev}) => ({
        post: {...},
        otherProp: {...}
      })
      // getProps is a n asynchronous function that is passed the
      // resolved `route` object and a `dev` boolean indicating
      // whether this is a production build or not. This function
      // should resolve any data the route needs to render eg. blog
      // posts, API data, etc.

      noindex: false, // Optional. Defaults to `false`. If `true`, will exclude this route from the sitemap XML
      permalink: '', // Optional. If not set, will default to (siteRoot + path)
      changeFreq: 60000, // Optional.
      lastModified: '', // Optional. String('YYYY-MM-DD')
      priority: 0.5 // Optional.
    }],
  }],

  siteRoot: 'https://mysite.com', // Optional, but necessary for the sitemap.xml

  // An optional custom React component that renders the base
  // Html for every page, including the dev server. Must utilize the
  // `Html`, `Head`, `Body` and `children` for react-static to work. The optional
  // `staticMeta` prop refers to any data you potentially returned from
  // the `preRenderMeta` and `postRenderMeta` function.
  Html: ({ Html, Head, Body, children, staticMeta }) => (
    <Html lang="en-US">
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      </Head>
      <Body>{children}</Body>
    </Html>
  ),

  // An optional callback, used to modify the webpack config for both dev
  // and production. The function you provide will be passed an instance of
  // webpack-configurator (see https://github.com/lewie9021/webpack-configurator
  // for more information), and an object containing a `dev` boolean, denoting
  // whether you are in development or production mode.
  webpack: (webpackConfigurator, { dev }) => {...},

  // The entry location for your app, defaulting to `./src/index.js`
  // This file must export the JSX of your app as the default export,
  // eg. `default export <MyApp />`.
  // It also handles the rendering of your app while in development mode
  // (including hot reloading). For a brief example, see the Project
  // Setup section above.
  entry: './src/index.js',

  // An optional asynchronous function that is pass the JSX component
  // BEFORE it is rendered to a static string. It can return a javascript
  // object that will be made available to a custom Html component
  preRenderMeta: async JSX => {...},

  // An optional asynchronous function that is passed the statically
  // rendered HTML for each page and returns a javascript object
  // that will be made available to a custom Html component
  postRenderMeta: async staticHTML => {...},

  // Optional. Set to true to serve the bundle analyzer on a production build.
  bundleAnalyzer: false,
}
```

## Components & Tools

#### `<Router />`
The `Router` component is react-static's special version of React-Router's `Router` component. It is to be used in conjunction with other React Router components. By using react-static's `Router` at the base of your app, you won't have to worry about switching between static routing and browser routing. It accepts a `history` object like you're used to (to support things like react-router-redux), and also provides a helper method to subscribe to loading events.

Example:
```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-static'
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router'

import Home from './containers/Home'
import About from './containers/About'
import Blog from './containers/Blog'

export default () => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/blog" component={Blog} />
      <Redirect to="/" />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
)
```

To Subscribe to Router loading events, use `Router.subscribe(callback)`.
The subscribe callback will fire whenever the loading state changes.

Example:
```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-static'

Router.subscribe(loading => {
  if (loading) {
    console.log('A page is loading!')
  } else {
    console.log('A page is done loading!')
  }
})
```

#### Routing Components
`react-static` also provides you with all other necessary routing components and utils via `react-router`.

These include:
- `<Link>`
- `<NavLink>`
- `<Prompt>`
- `<Redirect>`
- `<Route>`
- `<Switch>`
- `history`
- `matchPath`
- `withRouter`

To learn how these `react-router` components work, visit [React-Router-Web's documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

#### `getRouteProps(Component)`
`getRouteProps` is an HOC that provides a component with the results of the current route's `getProps` function as defined in your `static.config.js`. Here is a simple example:

**static.config.js**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  getRoutes: () => [{
    path: '/top-100-songs',
    getProps: async () => ({
      songs: await SpotifyAPI.getTopSongs(100)
    })
  }]
}
```

**App.js**
```javascript

const TopHundredSongsPage = getRouteProps(({songs}) =>
  <ul>
    {songs.map(song => <li key={song}>{song}</li>)}
  </ul>
)

...
<Route exact path="/top-100-songs" component={TopHundredSongsPage} />
...
```

#### `<Head />`
`Head` is a react component for managing tags in the document's `head`. Use it to update meta tags, title tags, etc.

- It can be used anywhere in your app.
- If called more than once on a route, it will append and merge them together (and overwrite some tags with the latest tag used).
- For more information, see the [React-Helmet library](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) that `react-static` uses to accomplish this.

Example:
```javascript
import { Head } from 'react-static'

export () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>This is my page title!</title>
    </Head>
    <div>
      My page content...
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

#### `<Prefetch path=''/>`
Prefetch is a react component that accepts a `path` prop and an optional single child to render. When this component is rendered, any data resolved by the `path`'s corresponding `getProps` function will be prefetched. This ensures that if the user then navigates to that route in your site, they do not have to wait for the required data to load.

- If the path doesn't match a route, no data will be loaded.
- If the route has already been loaded in the session, the cache will be used instead.
- If multiple instances of the same `path` are prefetched at the same time, only a single request will be made for all instances.
- If used more often than needed, this component could result in fetching a lot of unused data. Be smart about what you prefetch.

Example:
```javascript
import { Prefetch } from 'react-static'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// Standalone
<Prefetch path='/blog' />

// With children
<Prefetch path='/blog'>
  <Link to='/blog'>
    Go to blog
  </Prefetch>
</Prefetch>
```

#### `prefetch(path)`
`prefetch` is an imperative version of the `Prefetch` component that you can use anywhere in your code.

Example:
```javascript
import { prefetch } from 'react-static'

const myFunc = async => {  
  const data = await prefetch('/blog')
  console.log('The preloaded data:', data)
}
```
