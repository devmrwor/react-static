## Quick Start
```bash
$ yarn global add react-static
# or npm install -g react-static

$ react-static create my-static-site
```

## Installation

#### New Projects
To start a new project, install `react-static` globally:
```bash
$ yarn global add react-static
# or
$ npm install react-static -g
```

To create a new project:
```bash
$ react-static create
```

#### Existing Projects
To migrate a project, install `react-static` locally:
```bash
$ yarn add react-static
# or
$ npm install react-static --save
```
For more details on migrating an existing app, see the [Project Setup](#project-setup) section.


## CLI

#### `react-static create`
Creates a new react-static project.
- Prompts for a project name/location
- Prompts to select one of the templates located in this repository's `examples/` directory.

#### `react-static start`
Starts the development server.

#### `react-static build`
Builds your site for production. Outputs to a `dist` directory in your project.

## Project Setup
`react-static` needs a few directories and files in the right places to function properly:

- `static.config.js` - A javascript configuration file for react-static. [Click here to see an example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/basic/static.config.js)
- `public/` - Anything in this directory will be merged into your static `dist` directory. All files in this directory can be accessed at the root of your site.
- `src/` - a place for all of your code
  - `index.js` - the main entry for your app. This file should export your app as its default export and also handle the rendering of the app when using the development server. [Click here to see an example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/basic/src/index.js).

## Configuration (`static.config.js`)
A `static.config.js` file is required at your project root to configure react-static. It must export a **default** object with the following interface:
```javascript
export default {
  // getRoutes is the only required method for the entire config.
  // It is an asynchronous function that should
  // resolve an array of route objects. It is also passed a `dev`
  // boolean indicating whether this is a production build or not.
  getRoutes: async ({dev}) => [{
    path: '/' // A route object requires a `path` string
    component: 'src/containers/Home', // specify the react component that will render this route
  }, {
    path: '/blog',
    component: 'src/containers/Blog',
    children: [{ // It can also contained nested routes
      path: '/post-1',
      component: 'src/containers/Post',
      getProps: async ({route, dev}) => ({
        post: {...},
        otherProp: {...}
      })
      // getProps is a n asynchronous function that is passed the
      // resolved `route` object and a `dev` boolean indicating
      // whether this is a production build or not. This function
      // should resolve any data the route needs to render eg. blog
      // posts, API data, etc.

      noindex: false, // Optional. Defaults to `false`. If `true`, will exclude this route from the sitemap XML
      permalink: '', // Optional. If not set, will default to (siteRoot + path)
      lastModified: '', // Optional. String('YYYY-MM-DD')
      priority: 0.5 // Optional.
    }, {
      // If using automatic routing, you can specify a component to render the
      // 404 page by creating a route with `is404` set to `true` and defining a
      // `component` to use.
      is404: true,
      component: 'src/containers/NotFound'
    }],
  }],

  // getSiteProps is very similar to a route's getProps, but is made available
  // to the entire site via the `getSiteProps` HOC
  // IMPORTANT: Any data you return here, although loaded once per session, will
  // be embedded in every page that is exported on your site. So tread lightly ;)
  getSiteProps: async ({dev}) => ({...})

  siteRoot: 'https://mysite.com', // Optional, but necessary for the sitemap.xml

  // An optional custom React component that renders the base
  // Document for every page, including the dev server. If used, it must utilize the
  // `Html`, `Head`, `Body` and `children` for react-static to work. The optional
  // `siteProps` prop will contain any data returned by `getSiteProps` in your config
  // and `renderMeta` prop refers to any data you potentially assigned to it during
  // the custom `renderToHtml` hook.
  Document: ({ Html, Head, Body, children, siteProps, renderMeta }) => (
    <Html lang="en-US">
      <Head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      </Head>
      <Body>{children}</Body>
    </Html>
  ),

  // An optional function or array of functions to transform the webpack config.
  // Each function will receive the previous webpack config, and expect a
  // modified or new config to be returned (or undefined if you wish not to modify
  // the config)
  webpack: [(previousConfig, args) => newConfig],

  // The entry location for your app, defaulting to `./src/index.js`
  // This file must export the JSX of your app as the default export,
  // eg. `default export <MyApp />`.
  // It also handles the rendering of your app while in development mode
  // (including hot reloading). For a brief example, see the Project
  // Setup section above.
  entry: './src/index.js',

  // An optional function to customize the server rendering logic. Receives:
  // - render: renders the JSX to and html string
  // - Component: the final react component to be rendered to HTML
  // - meta, a MUTABLE object that is exposed to the optional Document component as a prop
  // Expected to return an HTML string
  // This is the perfect place for css-in-js integration (see styled-components and glamorous examples for more information)
  renderToHtml: (render, Component, meta) => {
    meta.hello = 'world'
    return render(<Component />)
  },

  // Optional. Set to true to serve the bundle analyzer on a production build.
  bundleAnalyzer: false,
}
```

## Webpack Config and Plugins
To modify the webpack configuration, use the `webpack` option in your `static.config.js` file.

```javascript
webpack: []Function(
  previousConfig,
  args: {
    stage,
    defaultLoaders: {
      jsLoader,
      cssLoader,
      fileLoader
    }
  }
) => {
  return newConfig // or a falsey value to cancel transformation
}
```
  - The value can be an array of functions or a single function.
  - Each function will receive the previous webpack config, and can return a modified or new config.
  - Return any falsey value to cancel the transformation
  - `args.stage` is a string of either `prod`, `dev` or `node`, denoting which stage react-static is building for.
  - `args.defaultLoaders` - A convenience object containing the default react-static webpack rule functions:
    - `jsLoader` - The default loader for all `.js` files (uses babel)
    - `cssLoader` - The default style loader that supports importing `.css` files and usage of css modules.
    - `fileLoader` - The default catch-all loader for any other file that isn't a `.js` `.json` or `.html` file. Uses `url-loader` and `file-loader`

When `webpack` is passed an array of functions, they are applied in order from top to bottom and are each expected to return a new or modified config to use. They can also return a falsey value to opt out of the transformation and defer to the next function.

By default, React Static's webpack toolchain compiles `.js` and `.css` files. Any other file that is not a `.js` `.json` or `.html` file is also processed with the `fileLoader` (images, fonts, etc.) and will move to `./dist` directory on build. The source for all default loaders can be found in [react-static/lib/webpack/rules/](./src/webpack/rules).

Our default loaders are organized like so:
```javascript
const webpackConfig = {
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [{
      oneOf: [
        jsLoader, // Compiles all .js files with babel
        cssLoader, // Supports basic css imports and css modules
        fileLoader // Catch-all url-loader/file-loader for anything else
    }]
  }
  ...
}
```

**Note:** Usage of the `oneOf` rule is not required, but recommended. This ensures each file is only handled by the first loader it matches, and not any loader. This also makes it easier to reutilize the default loaders, without having to fuss with `excludes`. Here are some examples of how to replace and modify the default loaders:

**Replacing all rules:**
```javascript
// static.config.js

export default {
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.module.rules = [
      // Your own rules here...
    ]
    return config
  }
}
```

**Replacing a default loader for a different one:**
```javascript
// static.config.js
import { jsLoader, cssLoader, fileLoader } from 'react-static/lib/webpack/rules'

export default {
  webpack: (config, { defaultLoaders }) => {
    config.module.rules = [{
      oneOf: [
        defaultLoaders.jsLoader,
        {
          // Use this special loader
          // instead of the cssLoader
        }
        defaultLoaders.fileLoader,
      ]
    }]
    return config
  }
}
```

**Adding a plugin:**
```javascript
// static.config.js
import AwesomeWebpackPlugin from 'awesome-webpack-plugin'

export default {
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.plugins.push(new AwesomeWebpackPlugin())
    return config
  }
}
```

**Using multiple transformers:**

```javascript
// static.config.js
import { jsLoader, cssLoader, fileLoader } from 'react-static/lib/webpack/rules'

export default {
  webpack: [
    (config, { defaultLoaders }) => {
      config.module.rules = [{
        oneOf: [
          defaultLoaders.jsLoader,
          defaultLoaders.cssLoader,
          {
            loader: 'file-loader',
            test: /\.(fancyFileExtension)$/,
            query: {
              limit: 10000,
              name: 'static/[name].[hash:8].[ext]',
            },
          },
          defaultLoaders.fileLoader,
        ]
      }]
      return config
    },
    config => {
      console.log(config.module.rules) // Log out the final set of rules
    }
  ]
}
```

## Components & Tools

### `<Router>`
The `Router` component is required, and provides the underlying React-Router context to its children. It is often the root component of a react-static app.

`Router` automatically handles rendering both static and browser environments. It optionally accepts a `history` object (most-often used for things like react-router-redux), and also provides a helper method to subscribe to loading events.

Example:
```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-static'
import { Switch, Routes, Route } from 'react-router'

import Home from './containers/Home'
import About from './containers/About'
import Blog from './containers/Blog'
import NotFound from './containers/NotFound'

// For standard component routing:
export default () => (
  <Router>
    <Routes />
  </Router>
)

// For custom routing
export default () => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/blog" component={Blog} />
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
)
```

To Subscribe to Router loading events, use `Router.subscribe(callback)`.
This can be extremely useful when using a library like `nprogress` to show a loading status.
The subscribe callback will fire whenever the loading state changes:
```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-static'

Router.subscribe(loading => {
  if (loading) {
    console.log('A page is loading!')
  } else {
    console.log('A page is done loading!')
  }
})
```

### Automatic Routing with  `<Routes>`
`react-static` comes built in with a component router that automatically handles all of your routing for you. This is done by first, specifying a `component` path (relative to the root of your project) that should be used to render a route in your `static.config.js`

`static.config.js` example:
```javascript
export default {
  getRoutes: async () => [{
    path: '/'
    component: 'src/containers/Home',
  }]
}
```

When your site is built (both in dev and production mode), the special `<Routes>` component will automatically handle all of your routing based on the paths you define in your `static.config.js`

`App.js` example:
```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-static'
import Routes from 'react-static-routes' // A special `react-static-routes` import is used for Automatic Routing

export default () => (
  <Router>
    <Routes /> // Your <Routes /> can be nested anywhere inside the <Router /> component.
  </Router>
)
```

To see a working example, refer to our [`basic` example template](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/basic)

### Custom Routing
If you end up needing more control than `<Routes />` offers, have no fear. `react-static` provides you with all of the custom routing components you are normally used to with `react-router`:

**NOTE: These components are available via `react-static`. There is no need to import them via `react-router`**

- `<Route>`
- `<Switch>`
- `<Redirect>`
- `<Prompt>`

To build your own custom routing, simply remove (or don't use)  the `<Routes>` component in your app, and use the above components instead.

To see a working example, refer to our [`custom-routing` example template](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/examples/custom-routing)

To learn more about how `react-router` components work, visit [React-Router's Documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

### 404 Handling
Making a 404 page in `react-static` is extremely simple for both automatic and custom routing configurations.

##### Automatic Routing
To define a 404 page using automatic routing, define a route with `is404` set to `true` and a `component` path to render the 404 page. Note that no `path` property is needed for a 404 route. At both build time and run time, the rendered result of this `component` will be used for any routes that are not found.

##### Custom Routing
When using custom routing, there are 2 types of 404 pages:
- **Static 404 page** - At build time, `react-static` will automatically attempt to render a `/404` path in your app. Whatever renders as a result of this path will be exported to `404.html` and be used for pages not found on **first load**.
- **Dynamic 404 pages** - For `<Link>`s and in-app navigations that don't match your custom routing structure, you must handle those situations yourself. The best (and most thorough) way to handle this scenario is to make sure you use a catch all `<Route component={SomeComponent} />` at the end of **all** `<Switch>` statements in your app. Not all of them must point to the same 404 component, since you may want to show a custom 404 page for a post that isn't found, versus a page that isn't found.

### `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`
`react-static` also gives you access to `react-router`'s `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components. Use these component to allow your users to navigate around your site!

Usage:
```javascript
<Link to={'/blog/post/1'}>
  Go to Blog Post 1
</Link>
```

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Router, Link } from 'react-static'
//
import Routes from 'react-static-routes'

export default () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about/">About</Link>
        <Link to="/blog/">Blog</Link>
      </nav>
      <Routes />
    </div>
  </Router>
)
```

For more information about `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`, see [React-Router's Documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

### Other Routing Utilities
For your convenience, `react-static` also exports the following utilities normally exported by `react-router`.

- `history`
- `matchPath`
- `withRouter`

### `getRouteProps(Component)`
`getRouteProps` is an HOC that provides a component with the results of the current route's `getProps` function as defined in your `static.config.js`. Here is a simple example:

**static.config.js**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  getRoutes: () => [{
    path: '/top-100-songs',
    getProps: async () => ({
      songs: await SpotifyAPI.getTopSongs(100)
    })
  }]
}
```

**App.js**
```javascript

const TopHundredSongsPage = getRouteProps(({songs}) =>
  <ul>
    {songs.map(song => <li key={song}>{song}</li>)}
  </ul>
)

...
<Route exact path="/top-100-songs" component={TopHundredSongsPage} />
...
```

### `getSiteProps(Component)`
`getSiteProps` is an HOC that provides a component with the results of the `getSiteProps` function as defined in your `static.config.js`. Here is a simple example:

**static.config.js**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  getSiteProps: () => ({
    title: 'React Static',
    metaDescription: 'A progressive static-site framework for React'
  })
}
```

**App.js**
```javascript

const AnyComponent = getSiteProps(({ title, metaDescription }) =>
  <div>
    Welcome to {title}! I am a {metaDescription} :)
  </div>
)

```

### `<Head>`
`Head` is a react component for managing tags in the document's `head`. Use it to update meta tags, title tags, etc.

- It can be used anywhere in your app.
- If called more than once on a route, it will append and merge them together (and overwrite some tags with the latest tag used).
- For more information, see the [React-Helmet library](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) that `react-static` uses to accomplish this.

Example:
```javascript
import { Head } from 'react-static'

export () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
      <title>This is my page title!</title>
    </Head>
    <div>
      My page content...
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

### `<Prefetch path=''/>`
Prefetch is a react component that accepts a `path` prop and an optional single child to render. When this component is rendered, any data resolved by the `path`'s corresponding `getProps` function will be prefetched. This ensures that if the user then navigates to that route in your site, they do not have to wait for the required data to load.

- If the path doesn't match a route, no data will be loaded.
- If the route has already been loaded in the session, the cache will be used instead.
- If multiple instances of the same `path` are prefetched at the same time, only a single request will be made for all instances.
- If used more often than needed, this component could result in fetching a lot of unused data. Be smart about what you prefetch.

Example:
```javascript
import { Prefetch } from 'react-static'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// Standalone
<Prefetch path='/blog' />

// With children
<Prefetch path='/blog'>
  <Link to='/blog'>
    Go to blog
  </Link>
</Prefetch>
```

### `<PrefetchWhenSeen path=''/>`
PrefetchWhenSeen is almost identical to the Prefetch component, except that it will not fire its prefetch until the component is visible in the view. If the user's browser doesn't support the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API), it will work just like the Prefetch component.

Example:
```javascript
import { PrefetchWhenSeen } from 'react-static'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// Standalone
<PrefetchWhenSeen path='/blog' />

// With children
<PrefetchWhenSeen path='/blog'>
  <Link to='/blog'>
    Go to blog
  </Link>
</PrefetchWhenSeen>
```

### `prefetch(path)`
`prefetch` is an imperative version of the `Prefetch` component that you can use anywhere in your code.

Example:
```javascript
import { prefetch } from 'react-static'

const myFunc = async => {  
  const data = await prefetch('/blog')
  console.log('The preloaded data:', data)
}
```
